        <h2> Description</h2>
        <strong> Ramen recipe</strong>. Fresh vegetables? Quick and easy homemade broth? A soft-boiled egg and a pile of our favorite curly-cue packaged ramen noodles that remind us of college? That’s this homemade ramen.
        </p>

        <p> 
            <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
                <li> 3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
                <li> 4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
                <li> 4 cups broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
                <li>4 cups water </li>
                <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms </li>
                <li>2 packages instant ramen (noodles only!) </li>
                <li> 1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives </li>
                <li>  2 cup chopped kale </li>
                <li>  1 cups shredded carrots </li>
                <li>  Sriracha to taste </li>
                <li>  crunchy golden panko crumbs for topping </li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p> 
            <h2> Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Heat a pot of filtered water to 200 to 205F. We use an electric kettle that shows us the exact temperature. You could also use a teapot on the stove — just heat to boiling, then let the water cool down for a few minutes.</li>
                <li> Use a food scale to weigh out 34 grams of coffee, then grind it to a medium coarse grind (about the size of kosher or sea salt). We use an electric burr grinder to get a consistent grind. </li>
                <li> When the water is heated, place the filter in your Chemex (see the video below for exact instructions). Pour in just a bit of water to wet the filter, then pour out the water into the sink. Place the ground coffee into the Chemex and shake it to level it out.</li>
                <li> Place the Chemex on the food scale and tare it so the scale reads 0. Slowly pour in 70 grams of water in a circular motion. Then stop and wait for 1 minute: this allows the coffee to bloom (you may have to tap your scale once so that it doesn’t time out!).</li>
                <li>Then slowly add the remaining 520 grams water in two batches, pouring very slowly in concentric circles, pouring right onto the coffee and not touching the coffee filter. Fill to about ½ inch from the top (it will likely be around 400 grams water), wait for the water level to go down a bit, and then fill the remaining water up to 520 grams.</li>
                <li> After a few minutes, all of the water will filter through the coffee grounds into the pot below. Remove the filter and discard it (we compost ours).  Enjoy!</li>
